# Lecture 16: S3 101

## What is S3?

S3 provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, high-scalable object storage. Amazon S3 is easy to use, with a simple web services interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

## S3 the Basics

- S3 is a safe place to store your files.
- It is object-based storage
- the data is spread scross multiple devices
- There is unlimited storage
- Files are stored in buckets
	- Folder in the cloud
	- Has a universal namespace. Names must be unique globally
- When you upload a file to S3 you'll receive HTTP 200 if upload was successful

## Data Consistency Model for S3

- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
	- You will be able to read file immediatelys after uploading it
- Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES
	- Might not be able to view updates immediately after making changes
		- Mostly due to time required to update all distributed nodes with new info

## S3 is a Simple Key-value Store

- Objects consist of the following
	- Key (name of the object)
	- Value (The data made up of a sequence of byes)
	- Version ID (Important for Versioning)
	- Metadata (data about data that you're storing)
	- Subresources:
		- Access Control Lists (permissions on files)
		- Torrent (used for torrenting)
- built for 99.99% availability for S3 platform
- Amazon Guarantees 99.9% availability ("11 9s durability")
- Tiered Storage available
- Lifecycle Management
- Versioning
- Encryption
- Secure data using Access Control Lists and Bucket Policies

## S3 - Storage Tiers/Classes

- S3 Standard: 99.99% availability, 99.99999999999% durability, stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities, and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently
- S3 - IA (Infrequently Accessed): for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3, but you are charged a retrieval fee.
- S3 One Zone - IA: want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require the multiple Availability Zone data resilience 
- Glacier: Very cheap, but used for archival only. Expedited, Standard, or Bulk. A Standard retrieval time takes 3 - 5 hours.

## S3 - Charges

- Charged for:
	- Storage
	- Requests
	- Storage Management Pricing (e.g. charged for metadata)
	- Data Transfer Pricing
	- Transfer Acceleration

## What is S3 Transfer Acceleration?

Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your end users and an S3 bucket.

Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge location. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.

## S3 - Exam Tips for S3 101

- Remember that S3 is Object-based: i.e. allows you to upload files.
- Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB
- There is unlimited storage
- Files are stored in Buckets
- S3 is a universal namespace. That is, names must be unique globally. 
- Read after write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propogate)
- S3 Storage Classes/Tiers:
	- S3 (durable, immediately available, frequently accessed)
	- S3 - IA (durable, immediately available, infrequently accessed)
	- S3 One Zone - (even cheaper than IA, but only in one availability zone)
	- Glacier - Archived data, where you can wait 3 - 5 hours before accessing.
- Remember core fundamentals of an S3 Object:
	- Key (name)
	- Value (data)
	- Version ID
	- Metadata
	- Subresources
		- ACL
		- Torrent
- Object-based storage only (for files)
- Not suitable to install an operating system on
- Successful uploads return HTTP 200
